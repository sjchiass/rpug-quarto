# rpug-quarto

This is the rocker/verse image with a few layers added on for Python, a few Python packages, and a few R packages.

The image is used to build the RPUG website without having to wait 30+ minutes for packages to compile. Having packages already installed in the image is much faster.

The quarto13 tag is for an older version of Quarto. Recent versions of Quarto have broken the website. Until version 1.6 is released, version 1.3 of Quarto should work.
